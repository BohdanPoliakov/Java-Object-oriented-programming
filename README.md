# Task:
Develop a program that inputs the number and dimensions of rectangles from the keyboard and outputs the areas and perimeters of the rectangles.
# Program requirements:
Create a file called Main.java
In the generated file, describe:
1) The abstract class Figura, which contains two abstract methods: getArea and getPerimeter, both methods return a value of type double, both methods have no parameters.
2) The class Rectangle, which is the descendant of the class Figura (the methods getArea and getPerimeter have to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle). In addition, the Rectangle class must contain two double fields of type width and height and a constructor to initialize the given fields.
3) A public class Main containing the method main(). In the main method, do the following:
- Create an array of elements of type Figura. The number of elements must be entered from the keyboard.
- Fill the created array with objects of class Rectangle, the size of the rectangles must be entered from the keyboard. 
- Calculate the areas and perimeters of all the rectangles using the getArea and getPerimeter methods and output them to the screen (the area must be separated from the perimeter by a space, the information about each of the rectangles must be output on a new line, real numbers must be output with two decimal places).
# Special requirements for the program:
- At the beginning of the programme, place a comment containing information about the developer of the programme (student certificate number, name, group number).
- Input errors may not be handled.
- Test the program with tests on github.com.
